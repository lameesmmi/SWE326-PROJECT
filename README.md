# SWE 326 - Phase 3: Unit Testing - Cruise Control System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of SWE 326: Software Testing. In Phase 3, we developed and executed unit tests for a Java-based **Cruise Control System** using **JUnit** and **EclEmma**.

---

## ✅ Phase 3 Objectives
- Design unit test cases for individual components of the system.
- Execute all unit tests using JUnit.
- Measure code coverage using EclEmma.
- Document all findings in the Master Test Plan.
